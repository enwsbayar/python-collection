# Complete the method which returns the number which is most frequent in the given input array. If there is a tie for most frequent number, return the largest number among them.

# Note: no empty arrays will be given.

# Examples
# [12, 10, 8, 12, 7, 6, 4, 10, 12]              -->  12
# [12, 10, 8, 12, 7, 6, 4, 10, 12, 10]          -->  12
# [12, 10, 8, 8, 3, 3, 3, 3, 2, 4, 10, 12, 10]  -->   3
